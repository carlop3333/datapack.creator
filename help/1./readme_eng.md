## How to create a datapack
The editor is not finished so you can do a datapack in a Notepad ( I recomend use Notepad++ or VS Code)

1. create a folder with a name (Obviously)
2. Create a pack.mcmeta <---- **Important** with this template:
```
{
  "pack": {
    "pack_format": 6,
    "description": "A datapack example"
  }
}
```

### In the "pack_format":
_7_ is for Minecraft 1.17

_6_ is for Minecraft 1.16

_5_ is for Minecraft 1.15

_4_ is for Minecraft 1.14-1.13

Thats the begining to create datapacks
