## Testing the Datapack

Once you have done the **pack.mcmeta** you must test it in the game, when creating a world and going to Data Package you must click on Open Datapacks folder> Copy Datapack> Paste it into the folder.

It should come out like this:

Now that the datapack has appeared, you must (in the original folder) create another folder called **data**, such that:

We would enter the ** data ** folder and we would have many possibilities such as making Achievements, functions (they are like commands that do not have to be executed in a lot of command blocks, but in one (they are limited)), being able to create mobs, etc etc.

Here I leave you more tutorials so that you can learn each one:
